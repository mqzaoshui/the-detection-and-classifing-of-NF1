# the-detection-and-classifing-of-NF1

## Introduction
This project is based on yolov5 and transformer's self-attention mechanism as architecture developed project to detect and classify neuroma images. The self-attention mechanism is embedded into the backbone of yolov5 as a way to improve accuracy and inference speed.

### Environment Configuration
